# mbx-inventory
No Code Database for Managing Mesonet-in-a-Box Deployments and Inventory. This library provides a flexible `Inventory` class that can be adapted to use whichever backend you prefer. The only current supported inventory backend is AirTable. An example AirTable database that could be used with this library is linked here: [Example AirTable Base](https://airtable.com/appasuz41SO5upfoa/shrHWLUAPB4wiOHY0)
